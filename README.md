=============
Mainly experiments in using Go with the Hadoop Streaming utility. Hopefully this will also lead some insight into using [typedbytes](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/typedbytes/package-summary.html) as a medium for transmitting [gob](http://golang.org/pkg/encoding/gob/) streams as inputs to Streaming's mappers/reducers.
